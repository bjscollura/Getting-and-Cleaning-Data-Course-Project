Files included:

- codebook.md: Markdown file describing steps taken to convert raw data into tidy data, along with a list of variables in the final data sets and their descriptions
- README.md: this file!
- UCI HAR Dataset directory: original source files, with its own README file and descriptors. Useful for reference to measurement variables and source txt files imported into R via run_analysis.R
